# mars
City AI will build the first city on Mars. This is the space to build AI and robotics software for mars missions:

Ideas include:
- What about something imaging related 
Using pictures to do predictions of possible mining locations (so like minerals on earth or potential sites on mars)
Asteroid mineral composition based on images for asteroid mining 
Thereâ€™s available datasets from past sample collection missions - moon, mars, and a couple asteroids too

- What about risk related
Reducing cost for rocket manufacturing by cutting down supply chain inefficiencies.
Partnering with SpaceX, Lockheed, etc. Providing robots for rocket manufacturing
reduce delays by helping logisitics team increase risk visibility, advanced risk mitgation strategies to save money and helping logisitcs teams manage risk on rocket shipments
